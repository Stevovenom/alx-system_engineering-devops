The project task involves Networking basics. Basically, the introductory part of i starts with the introoduction to the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)  "provides a common basis for the coordination of standards development for the purpose of systems interconnection." In the OSI reference model, the communications between systems are split into seven different abstraction layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.
Each layer in the OSI model has well-defined functions, and the methods of each layer communicate and interact with those of the layers immediately above and below as appropriate.

<u><b>Introduction to LANs, WANs, and Other Kinds of Area Networks</b></u>
The common types of Area networks are:
1. WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) -  A LAN based on Wi-Fi wireless network technology.

2. <u>LAN (Local Area Network)</u> - It connects devices over a relative short distance.In TCP/IP networking, a LAN is often, but not always, implemented as a single IP subnet.In addition to operating in a limited space, LANs are also typically owned, controlled, and managed by a single person or organization. These networks also tend to use certain connectivity technologies, primarily <b>Ethernet</b> and <b>Token Ring</b>.

3.<u> WAN (Wide Area Network)</u>- A WAN spans a large physical distance and the internet is the largest WAN, spanning the Earth.A WAN differs from a LAN in several important ways. Most WANs (like the internet) aren't owned by a single organization. Instead, WANs exist under collective or distributed ownership and management. WANs tend to use technology like ATM, Frame Relay, and X.25 for connectivity over the longer distances.

4. <u>SAN (Storage Area Network)</u> - Connects servers to data storage devices through technology like Fibre Channel.

5.<u> MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)</u> - A network spanning a physical area larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN, such as a city. A MAN is typically owned and operated by a single entity such as a government body or large corporation.

Within the LAN, WAN and Home networking, Residences typically employ one LAN and connect to the internet WAN through an internet service provider (ISP) using a broadband modem. The ISP provides a WAN IP address to the modem, and all the computers on the home network use LAN IP addresses (also called private IP addresses).

<u><b> What is a MAC Address? </b></u>
A Media Access Control (MAC) address is a string of characters that identifies a device on a network. It’s tied to a key connection device in your computer called the network interface card, or NIC. The NIC is essentially a computer circuit card that makes it possible for your computer to connect to a network. A NIC turns data into an electrical signal that can be transmitted over the network.
MAC addresses are useful for network diagnosis because they never change, as opposed to a dynamic IP address, which can change from time to time
On wireless networks, a process called MAC filtering is a security measure to prevent unwanted network access by hackers and intruders. In MAC address filtering, the router is configured to accept traffic only from specific MAC addresses. This way, computers whose MAC addresses are approved will be able to communicate through the network — even if they were given a new IP address by the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) process.

<b>  	Difference Between MAC Address and IP Address</b>
The basic difference between an IP address and a MAC address is that an IP address represents software and a MAC address represents hardware. The MAC address identifies specific devices within the same local network and the IP address identifies those devices outside of the local network.

One can know his/her MAC address either throgh the command prompt or bu using the network settings using their Windows OS.
