The task involves the understanding of the loops, conditions and parsing.
The task involves the generation of a new SSH key but for my case I had used powershell for simplicity and the steps to successfully create a new SSH key is as follows:

1. Open powershell and run the command "ssh-keygen" and basically it willstart generating the new ssh key.
2. After this, it will prompt you to give a new file name but in this case I would advice you to use a new name which does not exist in your pc.
3. Then you will get another prompt to give the passphrase which will be your password and then confirm it.
4. After all this the SSH key would have been created and the public and the private keys would have been saved in the named files in the information that would follow down.
